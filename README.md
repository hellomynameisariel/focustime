# FocusTime

Welcome to **FocusTime** — a lightweight session timer designed to complement **Focusmate** and help you stay locked in during virtual coworking sprints.

I built this because I wanted a timer that respected my schedule, not the other way around. With FocusTime, you set when your next session starts and how long it lasts — and it does the rest.

**FocusTime** counts you in, keeps you focused, and gently alerts you when your time is almost up.

No logins. No ads. No guilt. Just a clean, flexible timer that works the way you do.

- **Countdown until your session starts**, including a green "2-minute warning."

## Why I Built It

I'm not a developer by trade — just someone who works better with the right tools in place.

FocusTime was made to support the kind of intentional, body-doubled work I do on Focusmate, without distraction or fuss. It gives me just enough structure to stay committed, and just enough space to stay flexible.
